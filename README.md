pybind_python_example
=====================

This is a fork of the [python_example](https://github.com/pybind/python_example)
project.  It includes scripts to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for building
the extension and extracting the resulting wheel which can then be installed in
other docker images that are built from [python:3.10](https://hub.docker.com/_/python).
